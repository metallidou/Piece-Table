# Piece Table
This is my C++ implementation of the [Piece Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table) data structure, which is mainly used in text editors, as it offers easy undo/redo operations and fast text modifications. 

## How to build and run
Make the script executable
```
chmod +x build.sh
```
Run script
```
./build.sh
```
Run main
```
./build/main
```
Run unit tests
```
./build/unit_test
```

## Testing
Unit tests are implemented using <b>Catch2</b>, a modern C++ testing framework, which is simple and efficient. <br />
